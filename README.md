GroFi is a LSD platform that focuses on Sui users that are not into DeFi but into its Sui dApp ecosystem and provides a way to be part of the ecosystem and receive from it in exchange.

We believe DeFi is an important part of the blockchain space, most of the possible mainstream users don't have an economic background and are not interested into things like impermanent lose, arbitrage, staking pools, and derivatives, so traditional DeFi it's only suitable for a small chunk of what the blockchain user base should be. Our view is that Sui will really grow around dApps that provide day to day value to regular users, such as gaming, multimedia entertainment and social networking.

The aim of GroFi is providing value to users from the projects of the ecosystem they're into while they provide financial value back to those projects, thus creating an ecosystem circular growth where dApps and users feedback each other.

The main ideas behind Grofi are:
- users stake SUI to a set of validators based on fair commission, good performance and value provided to the ecosystem
- users receive and stake oSUI into projects they want to support
- users receive project tokens, in-game assets, nft's, or other perks in exchange of a share of their rewards
- users can borrow project assets in exchange of future staking rewards
- projects receive funding from the users rewards to support their implementation
- projects provide assets and benefits to the users supporting them
- projects are provided with a marketplace for trading their assets
- projects are selected and audited by GroFi and the community itself
